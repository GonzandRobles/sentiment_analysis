0,Abdul Rafay K.,Chapel Hill| NC,12/15/2019,5.0,I spent about two hours here in order to focus on my work. I ordered the latte which was soothing and refreshed me for work. They have tables close to power outlets. The staff is very courteous. The music also helps concentrate. I highly recommend this place for focus work.
1,Jennifer L.,Seattle| WA,1/27/2019,4.0,I love the vibe here! It gets pretty busy especially when there are students returning back to school and studying.. but none the less it's a chill spot not so great in the customer service department but that's okay most people come not to be talked to anyway! The latte is tasty and is worth the buck I used to work at Starbucks and can say the coffee here is WELL MADE. Do not come here with a large group... do not be those people taking up half the space in this place. It's always packed and packing yourselves by the door is uncomfortable for everyone else.PRO: good coffee chill atmosphere hipster feelCON: parking on the street packed area
2,Stacy A.,Federal Way| WA,11/5/2019,3.0,Probably I came here on the wrong day because I went here to do my homework and the wifi wasn't working at all which was super frustrating because I really like Bluebeard Coffee! Sadly I left. I've been here before and their coffee is amazing and the people are too! Many seating for people to do homework chit chat with friends or just grabbing a quick bite!
3,Yoni C.,Issaquah| WA,11/3/2019,5.0,It was after visiting Tacoma Art Museum and nice to stop by here. I really liked my latte and the vibe here. Warm and welcoming. Latte was so rich and strong enough to please me and the art was fluttering. Loved the upper windows and interiors aesthetically pleasing
4,Keri F.,Seattle| WA,8/18/2019,5.0,Wonderful cafe and roasterie in Tacoma. Came here to study and the cafe is very spacious and relaxed. Great prices and friendly baristas/staff. Would recommend/come here again when I'm in the area. We got lattes. Tasted great and impressive latte art.
5,Damon B.,Washington| DC,11/24/2018,5.0,"This is a great third wave coffeeshop and is probably one of the top ones in the Tacoma area. It would be a top shop in any city.They have a pretty impressive roasting operation on site so they are bagging coffees right behind the counter. The wide variety of coffee available was pretty impressive and so was the carefully crafted quality. These baristas know what is up and it shows in the coffee they produce.I was a bit intimidated by the customer service at first I guess they were deadpanning me and not smiling. But after engaging the baristas a bit they were super warm and affable. And by ""a bit"" I mean after the first sentence I felt like we were old friends. Also I was a totally annoying customer carting around two unruly toddlers who wanted to tear the place apart so I appreciated a warm smile and helpful suggestion on the best coffees to purchase.The shop itself is pretty large but is also often crowded owing to free internet and it being a comfortable place to hang out. I dropped in twice during a visit and spent way too much money on lattes and pour overs and was blown away by everything that came out. They also have pastries that are pretty good but no hot foods at the time of my visit.I was also really impressed with their branding. It was just superb and they had a number of great branded items like hats and tshirts you could purchase. I was tempted but a few more visits and I don't know I'd probably cave."
6,McKenna W.,Tacoma| WA,11/11/2019,4.0,Great service and atmosphere. The selection of roasted beans is great. Had a latte and wasn't impressed. Willing to try something else next time.
7,Jack H.,Delray Beach| FL,11/1/2019,5.0,Awesome coffee and the Baristas are really nice. I was staying in Tacoma for 5 days and went to  Bluebeard almost every day I was there. The staff was really friendly and helpful especially recommending things to do around the area. The coffee was awesome as well!
8,Korki L.,Ballard| Seattle| WA,4/5/2019,3.0,"Mixed thoughts. Originally came here based on a recommendation as it was featured in la marzocco showroom in Queen Anne.. or so I was told. True or not true... I checked it out anyways with an image in my head that it would be as modern as Olympia coffee cafes. I had not yelp or instagram or done any research on Bluebeard aside the fact it was solely recommended to me as I was on my way to explore Tacoma. Coming in I saw a decent space bad use of space and round table choices... hard to share really when second chair is used for bag sitting.. Anyhow behind the roaster were employees and one with a ""bends down to table level and texted away"". I expected professionalism or cool action or coffee enthusiasts.. but I guess it was all in my head.  expectations and the reality did not meet. It was overall decent serving considering it is located in Tacoma where the competition is truly nonexistent. They definitely were going a different vibe which I can respect and I had not gotten to try all selections. I probably wouldn't go back mainly to the grudge vibe and just overall execution of the place. As stated I expected Olympia aesthetics and more polished coffee. Bluebeard can't please everyone."
9,Giovanni V.,Saint Petersburg| FL,10/31/2019,4.0,Being new to Tacoma I have been looking for a good coffee shop. I ordered the Tanzania pour over. It was very flavorful. Service was quick and the server was very warm and inviting. The atmosphere is very spacious. Plenty of seating and quite. The only issue is finding parking. I'll definitely  return. Solid coffee shop. Can't wait to try all your different roasts.
10,G S.,Clarkston| WA,9/29/2019,3.0,Just not a fan of the flavor or the coffee. Left a funky aftertaste.  Service was good and they seemed to have a decent selection of pastries.
11,Rowan L.,Puyallup| WA,3/17/2019,5.0,Oh my gosh This was a great experience! When I tried to order the Nitro cold brew the lady taking my order said that they were out. Oh no! But that's ok because I didn't really want it that much haha! She then brightly suggested that I get an Iced americano with a bit of vanilla. I then saw their bakery and ordered a GLUTEN FREE Peanut butter bar. Wow was I in for a total surprise! The bar was clearly made to perfection and it made me feel like I was eating one of grandmas desserts. The iced americano with a hint of vanilla was perfect and the vibe of the Bluebeard Cafe was truly amazing! What a great experience to have! I would 10/10 recommend this to anyone!
12,Jason M.,Palm Bay| FL,10/8/2019,5.0,This is one of my top 2 favorite places to go in Tacoma for fresh lighter-roasted (higher flavor and caffeine) coffee. I almost always have a bag at home for my Chemex and I've never been disappointed. I drink it black. When I visit the shop I'll usually have a latte.
13,Ricky R.,Tacoma| WA,2/1/2019,4.0,Always up for trying new local coffee. I grabbed a black drip and it was pretty good. Its not quite as good as my favorite but a decent cup of coffee. The staff was cool and it would be a chill place to go and read or talk with a friend while grabbing a cup. I would recommend this place. The shop is pretty large. I dont know if they roast on site but I would like to try a cup again and an americano in the future.
14,Kaylynn C.,Port Orchard| WA,11/25/2019,4.0,Great coffeeas a barista across the water I can say that this is the most authentic menu I've seen around! They actually roast their beans in house which is pretty special. The seating was much larger than I anticipated. No formal parking lot can be tricky to find parking along the street. I probably would've given it 5 stars though because it really seem like they take their craft of caffe as an art only serving quality shots. My issue is that I came here with it being advertised as a great spot to do work with lots of seating and internet available. I walked in and ordered a drink and a brioche (quite a few bakery options looked good and mine was okay kinda weird that they ask if you'd like it heated and then guide you to the communal microwave but whatever) my drink was ready soon and I grabbed a spot to crank out a paper for school. I connected to the WiFi and was able to use google and my email but couldn't do much else such as open a word document online do research or use my schools website. I asked the gentleman sitting next to me if he encountered this problem and he said he had and he's using his phones hotspot instead and that he came sometime last month and had the same issue. As I was looking on the WiFi connections I realized that most of it was hotspot connections. I thought it was idiotic to go to an Internet cafe to use your own hotspot so ended up going to another cafe to crank out my homework :(
15,Stranto F.,Camden| Camden| ME,11/29/2019,4.0,They've got great coffee and it's a good place to meet people. Their La Pistola is especially delicious. Also just to note that I've noticed an improvement with their staff and food offerings over this year.
16,Erin P.,Olympia| WA,8/17/2019,5.0,Great place with great character from the building to the great staff while the coffee is delicious and the peanut butter bars are so yum!
17,Nikki G.,Haysville| KS,11/15/2019,4.0,I was looking for a place to do homework and came here and i loved it! Everyone there was so nice and they play really good music (not that important but should be noted). There's a bunch of comfortable seating or bar like seating near the window. The only downfall is the parking. I just parked in the neighborhood behind and walked not too bad a very worth it.
18,Lydia A.,Mount Hope| KS,1/4/2019,5.0,Bluebeard coffee is the place to be in Tacoma. The atmosphere is very hip modern and industrial feeling. The beans are roasted there and the coffee tastes AMAZING. I've also bought their beans to make at home and it was so smooth and rich. It's the perfect place to meet friends and be productive. Also the baristas are super friendly and will help you pick something if you can't decided. Would recommend!
19,Jennifer B.,Olympia| WA,5/13/2018,5.0,Amazing hemp milk latte!Always friendly service even when they're busy. I love the atmosphere here especially all the sunlight through the nearly floor to ceiling windows that line both exterior walls. Just lovely! They made a yummy steamer for my kiddo with the perfect amount of foam - she actually didn't scream for whipped cream this time!
0,Travis B.,Bainbridge Island| WA,10/22/2019,3.0,"I always get a great bag here. Their Ethiopian coffee  is super. Aside from the coffee customers are sometimes treated as a nuisance. Being called ""boss"" (I'm not one) or ""my guy"" (not that either) is not affable nor cordial. Noticed the counter person wasn't so cavalier with the female patrons. A genuine hello and thanks would go along way. Thanks"
1,Justin E.,Tacoma| WA,3/20/2018,4.0,First time here: took one of my friends here and he equally enjoyed it!  The atmosphere is incredible the staff is very friendly the coffee is amazing and overall I would give this place a major two thumbs up.  I rated it a four instead of a five only because seating at the time we went was a bit limited and the only ones available was by the windows facing sixth and it was a bit hot because the sun was beaming it's radiant heat.  We wished that they had some shades like a lot of other shops have for when the sun is shining but I'd only knock it down half a star for that if I could lol!  Will definitely still be coming back!
2,Angie D.,Seattle| WA,8/15/2018,3.0,Good coffee. TERRIBLE customer service. Can improve the customer experience by addressing someone once they are at the register.
3,Desyree A.,Tacoma| WA,7/16/2019,5.0,Dude best coffee ever! They truly make it with love! I wish I still had my pic because their coffe art is on point!
4,Sara F.,Seattle| WA,12/24/2016,4.0,The best place in Tacoma to meet with a friend and chit chat.  Its dining room is large and in charge - you're likely to find a place to relax and your words aren't shared with the entire coffeehouse.My friend Jenny and I love to frequent coffee places and talk for over an hour so yes - as of December '16 - this is the best spot for it.The coffee is good they have several delicious gluten-free snacks (not that I'm allergic to gluten but for those that are) and easy to-go cups or a cute variety of in-house mugs.  Their chai tea is a little bit spicy for me and they don't have a milder or sweeter version and the prices are a little on the high side but this is a great spot to enjoy company.
5,Bonnie H.,Tacoma| WA,4/15/2019,5.0,Great spot for a coffee brew instead of a beer brew! Had a work meeting here and the vibe was like a brewery but for coffee which is cool and more work appropriate!
6,Peggi B.,Tacoma| WA,2/4/2019,5.0,I love this place it's hard to find hemp milk and they have it! Every time I go the employees are so nice and always greet you with a Smile. The place is kept clean and has a great vibe. I do wish they had a drive up window out of convenience haha but I love to meet girlfriends here or stop in on my way home from work! I will be back!
7,May S.,Tacoma| WA,7/19/2018,3.0,I can totally understand the appeal of this place. Its spacious has a laid back atmosphere and is fairly quiet. The staff was super friendly. I also liked that there were plenty of milk substitutes (I had soy in my coffee). The coffee itself was average. I enjoyed my caramel macchiato with soy milk. I could completely see this place as a nice place to study or catch up with friends. 3/5
8,Tiffany M.,Tacoma| WA,1/8/2019,4.0,Had coffee here very cool laid back atmosphere with a friendly staff. It was fun watching them prep coffee beans.
9,Lady L.,Redmond| WA,5/11/2019,5.0,Bluebeard's coffee and espresso is soo good!  They have a La Marzocco espresso machine which are the best.  They offer a huge variety of drinks.  Their La Pistola and Nitro Cold Brew are very popular.  They offer oat milk which is a popular dairy alternative.  They also have a nice selection of pastries.  This cafe is in a gorgeous older building with lots of character huge windows and comfortable couches.  The customer base is diverse and there are many loyal regulars.
10,Devyn C.,Tacoma| WA,12/9/2018,5.0,Hands down favorite coffee shop in Tacoma. In house espresso is delicious and their coffee beans are the best!! We go through a bag of beans a week at home. Their Christmas blend Snowbeard is my absolute favorite!!
11,Kim B.,Boise| ID,8/1/2019,3.0,This place has excellent coffee and a very large sitting space. If I lived in the area this would be a great spot to hang with friends. I sat in here working and this place filled up and stayed full pretty much the whole time I was here. I ordered a latte with light vanilla and it was delicious. Coffee is on point. There are a few downside. I felt like there is a click here at this coffee shop which is great for people in the click however I was just visiting from out of state and randomly picked this place because there was a spot to park and the yelp reviews. It seemed like the Baristas were friendlier to the locals or regulars. Which doesn't make it the most inviting for outsiders. I walked up to order and there really wasn't a clear place to order and there was 2 barista behind the bar and a few patrons standing talking on my side of the counter. I could clearly see that they had already been served. I kinda stood their awkwardly waiting to order. I then had to ask what the WiFi was and I misunderstood what he had said. So I confirmed and he then said no it's the name of the coffee shop you're in in a rude slightly condescending tone. Well I didn't know the name of the coffee shop I was in since I randomly walked it. I want a coffee shop to be welcoming and warm and this wasn't it.
12,James D.,Seattle| WA,12/15/2018,5.0,Whenever in Tacoma. Be sure to stop into Bluebeard Coffee Roasters. Spacious with plenty of tables chairs and window seats to enjoy your beverage while reading a book searching the internet or sharing a conversation with a friend or loved one. There's an adjacent room in the back that has additional seating and has the vibe of an old hotel lobby.
13,Samantha G.,Seattle| WA,6/14/2018,5.0,"Old school hip hop playing cool vibes and great smells. I was excited to try this place out after a coworker recommended it. I wasn't disappointed. I tried a double of the Narrows first. It was a really bright summery roast with strong citrus notes. That style is not my ""cup o espresso"" so I perused the bags and read the descriptions. I chatted with the barista (perhaps owner - blonde gentleman with a flat billed ball cap on - very nice guy/very knowledgeable which is why I thought manager/owner). When I ordered I thought I was trying the Columbia because I looked at the wrong signage (my fault!) but he kindly offered me a shot of the Columbia on the House!  Totally blown away by the awesome customer service. With the first sip of the Columbia I started walking back to the bags and picked one up. Brewed it in my machine this am and it is still top notch!  Thank you!  You have yourself a solid new customer! (Side note:  I would like to apologize to anyone I spoke with after a quad shot.)"
14,Amanda B.,Auburn| WA,7/25/2018,5.0,My favorite coffee shop of all time. Coffee comes standard double shot and has a flavor that is to die for. Perfect coffee house vibe and amazing squash bread... but get there early or they may run out! Highly recommend
15,Alexander K.,Columbus| GA,4/20/2018,5.0,A Gem in the Pacific North West (PNW) Bluebeard Coffee Roasters is located on a street with the likes of many other award winning Roasting rooms.  I personally think that Bluebeard does it best.  Their beans are always fresh and their customer service rivals none other.  My recommendations are to get the Macchiato (Espresso NOT Starbucks Macchiato) as well as their Latte.  You really cant go with any of their drink choices.  They offer a full line up of beans from around the world with all the up to date pour options. Love coming here to chill and hang. Cheers!
16,Jenny R.,Seattle| WA,4/27/2018,5.0,Great place. Latte was perfectly made chocolate cherry oat at was a nice twist! We will be back.
17,Steven G.,Seattle| WA,5/13/2017,5.0,You'll get incredible coffee here but Bluebeard's key ingredient which is missing from other shops in the area is a supberb ambiance. Here you'll enjoy plenty of windows mature indoor plants and stone tile floors which give way to roll-up doors for the ultimate indoor/outdoor experience. Premium soft-leather couches combined with plenty of round tables and even a bar counter ensures this as my favorite coffee shop to read enjoy spring weather or people watch.Plus they even sell temporary tattoos! The perfect way to carry an awesome morning throughout the rest of your day.
18,Tristan S.,Mountain View| CA,2/17/2018,3.0,I understand the popularity with Bluebeard Coffee I get it. A big spacious shop with a relaxing atmosphere and a supply of group games to enjoy while you hangout with friends. Unfortunately I found my chai latte pretty disappointing. I thought it was too rich with spices. And I know I will probably take some flak for this because I know I am by no means a trendy hipster but my god the music they played here was awful. It was like a playlist of post Velvet Underground artists who are knockoffs of Lou well trying to sound like the Sex Pistols at the same time. To each there own but it made me want to hangout there a little less. I'm sure there are better drinks on the menu than my chai and if you are into weird 80's underground punk this is the place for you.
19,Robert S.,Reno| NV,12/3/2015,5.0,"I'm a coffee snob.  In my hometown there are just a small handful of places that I can drink coffee at.  I need consistency I need good milk and I need it to be ""craft"" level.  Luckily I was sent here by the people at Valhalla.  On the weekends I usually get two cappuccinos.  So I got my second one here.  The coffee itself was good.  Not super memorable.  But they did have the best milk I had through the whole mini vacation.  And honestly that may be more important than the coffee at this point.  Because if you think about it...high end coffees aren't extremely different in their flavors.  But if you do the milk wrong...it all just doesn't live up.Anyway the interior is a little ""flour mill market"" sparse.  But they had a cool bar to sit at that faces 6th avenue.  The avenue that lets you look out on all the rugged hipsters that must live around here.In Reno we have ""hipsters"" with beards and stuff but they all dress sharply.  The hipsters in Tacoma seem a little less trendy and more real.  I know..strange observation...but really it's a coffee review and you just read the last paragraph.Glad this place is here when I return for my inevitable pilgrimage home each year.  Because from what I hear...there are only 3 craft coffee places in Tacoma.  I hope  that changes soon."
0,Hawt P.,Seattle| WA,6/11/2018,4.0,This place doesn't suck. They offer quality coffee at reasonable prices with a small selection of pastries. It's definitely a roastery and not necessarily a cafe as the decor is relatively sparse the space fairly open and loud. It's not a bad place though.
1,Tracy R.,San Francisco| CA,8/26/2018,3.0,I've tried going here so many times and find myself always wishing that it was more cozy and a place I can just hang out. Also the pastries/food just suck. It seems like they can make a better effort in this area and I've become so disappointed with their pastries that I'm starting to look around for a new coffee shop. I do love their La Pistola coffee drink though.
2,Kate Z.,Castle Rock| CO,6/1/2019,5.0,Stopped in for the first time yesterday and got the Nitro cold brew latte- highly recommend! Great tasting and I love that they use oat milk.
3,John Z.,Pacific| WA,9/12/2018,5.0,Blue beard is my favorite coffee shop in Tacoma. Also one of my favorite coffee shops all together. Iv been to many shops around the world a d blue beard just has great taste a good atmosphere and a nice big shops to be alone study read a book with space or to go here with a group.
4,M T.,Tacoma| WA,4/9/2019,5.0,Best coffee spot on 6thave from stadium all the way to Jackson. Coffeeservice and atmosphere is just about perfect.
5,Chad B.,Seattle| WA,12/4/2015,4.0,First and foremost the coffee is great. No shortage of girls in sweatpants either.Concrete floors and lots of glass windows means it can get fairly loud.WIfi is fast and reliable--just ask for the p/w.
6,Madison F.,Puyallup| WA,3/27/2019,5.0,Bluebeard has great coffee I would say top three places in Tacoma to get a cup! The service is always really quick the coffee is consistent and the people working behind the counter are incredibly friendly.
7,Mark A.,Pullman| WA,12/26/2017,5.0,My wife and I stopped here to meet some friends as we were passing through town!  The location is about 1 mile off the freeway with easy access and parking!  The building is a historic corner building with an amazing amount of natural light and windows!Service was quick and friendly.  Our lattes were made well in for-here mugs and they have a small number of snack-like items for sale as well.  Quality of lattes was good (both served with art)!  They also have self-serve water which I liked!My one recommendation would be to try and hide some of the back room clutter.  There is a bunch of stock items just on selves behind the counter and looks a little messy to the customer.  Not a big deal but just a suggestion to improve the atmosphere.Overall we enjoyed our visit and will be returning if we are in the area again!
8,Kevin R.,Walnut Creek| CA,11/23/2017,5.0,The nicest ladies work hereI have the Almond Latte and it's poured to perfectionNice selection of pastries It would be great if they had some Vegan sconesCoffee was greatThis is the one of my favorites in Tacoma must have passed three coffees houses to get here Try it you will not be disappointed
9,J. M.,Rancho Santa Margarita| CA,7/4/2018,5.0,Nice People awesome 3rd wave coffee friendly location!
10,Rylee R.,Auburn| WA,5/14/2018,4.0,The coffee really can't be beat. It's the best on 6th Ave for sure. It's where I go if I'm about to head out on a local walk or need good beans to grind and use at home. The single negative is the fact that there's never a place to sit. I can't ever suggest Bluebeard as a place to come with a friend because it's constantly overrun with remote worker types. They need to establish some sort of time limit rule but I could see that being difficult. Huge bummer because I'd love to show off this place more! It's great!
11,Devon D.,Middletown| RI,6/27/2018,5.0,We stopped in here quickly for an afternoon cold brew coffee on the suggestion of a friend and loved the coffee. The staff was incredibly friendly and happy and the whole experience was excellent. I would happily have a cold brew from here any day.
12,Seija W.,Seattle| WA,5/30/2018,5.0,High quality coffeehouse. Good coffee and tea. Friendly and informative baristas. Easy on the ears reggae going on the speakers makes for a chill vibe. Garage door on the side opens up for more light and air. Had to spend a few hours here and enjoyed it. Good WiFi. Try the spicy Mexican mocha it has a good kick balanced with chocolate.
13,Alexandria N.,Tacoma| WA,2/23/2018,4.0,A great spot to sit and get some work done. The coffee is good and the service is fast. I like all the event posters they have up that tie into the community.
14,This Way W.,San Diego| CA,8/22/2018,5.0,Bluebeard Coffee was definitely one of my favorite coffee shops we visited in the Tacoma/Seattle area. The baristas were quite helpful explaining their drinks and looked like they cared about the art of making coffee. We enjoyed our delicious drinks while smelling the amazing aroma coming from the coffee bean roaster located next to the front counter. The fragrance coming from the toasted beans was intoxicating filled with buttery caramel notes. I'm now on the lookout for coffee shop/roasters!
15,Beth S.,Yucaipa| CA,7/13/2018,5.0,This coffee was amazing! The barista recommended two different Brews for the espresso shots. Both were equally tasty with step and flavor notes. My son ordered the iced Americano and a peanut butter bar that he says was absolutely off the hook. We took bites of the peanut butter bar and the espresso shots and our mouths didn't know what was happening to it. Good in addition to knowing his coffee well the Barista told us the sights not to miss in Tacoma and where to have dinner. He was awesome
16,Ash M.,Tacoma| WA,6/14/2017,5.0,This is the ONLY place I've found so far near Hilltop that makes a decent espresso and cappuccino.  They could use more food options but for coffee its the place. I am a bit confused by the somewhat surly attitude from some of the staff I am not sure if they are having a bad day or just cranks.  However anyplace that opens at 6am and lets me refill my cup for $1 and use their wifi is high on my list.I am updating my review since I have had only good experiences and friendly staff every time I've been to Bluebeard in the past year.
17,Rose P.,Issaquah| WA,7/17/2017,4.0,Pros: Their mochas are good. I like their Mexican Mocha (I think it's called La Pistola) it has just the right amount of spice. I have had friends who have bought beans from them which I also enjoy but they are a little pricier then other options so I have held off buying them myself. I have only looked at their beans at third party retailers though. I forget to look when I actually go to Bluebeard!I love the garage doors and decor of the building. There is also a lot of seating. The baristas are fast which is nice. Cons: Every time I have been here it has been overwhelmingly busy but I have gone on only Sunday mornings. I didn't notice any flavored syrups you can add to your drink but due to busyness I always try to order asap so I don't look over the menu much.
18,Abigail S.,New York| NY,5/8/2017,5.0,The best coffee in Tacoma.There's no one currently pulling shots in Tacoma that is in the same league as Bluebeard. Consistently great coffee. I only wish there was one closer to my side of the city.In house roasting provides excellent beans for home brewing too.
19,Ron S.,Chandler| AZ,8/31/2016,5.0,Excellent coffee and excellent service.  I appreciate their expertise and attention to detail.  Day 1Coffee: Ethiopia - Misty Valley NaturalStyle: ChemexDay 2Coffee: Java - Skikandi SundaStyle: V60
0,Jacquelyn C.,Manhattan| NY,6/22/2017,5.0,Visiting my family here in Tacoma from New York there really aren't many places other than the Seattle area to get solid coffee. Came in to give this spot a try and I have got to say the lattes and cappuccinos are amazing. The beans are delicious and so are the pastries! The semi industrial interior makes the space casual and comfortable. It's a great place to kick back and work as well with all the space the cafe offers. The baristas are friendly and personable as well which is definitely a plus. Next time you're in the area I would say choose this cafe over all the others.
1,Tahnee R.,Bonney Lake| WA,12/29/2018,4.0,4 stars coffee is a'ight. If i were a hipster i would come here everyday. The girl behind yhe counter is gorgeous though.  That jaw line. Anyway the coffee is ok.
2,Jennifer L.,Lakewood| WA,10/23/2017,5.0,I absolutely love this coffee shop! I first came here a couple of weeks ago to meet up with an old friend and I fell in love with the atmosphere. Everyone was so nice and welcoming! I felt very comfortable here. I came back to just relax drink a chai tea latte and do some paper work. The drinks are delicious music is not too loud but it is relaxing and the location is wonderful. Can't get any better than this coffee shop!
3,Stephanie D.,Brooklyn| NY,6/27/2017,5.0,Their espresso is A+. Hands down my favorite place to come when I'm in Tacoma! I got their cranberry orange granola with help milk and a latte both times. Great service great atmosphere actually obsessed. Love this place.
4,Erin G.,Gig Harbor| WA,1/18/2016,4.0,Fantastic coffee some of the best!!In the last few years Tacoma has came on the scene with great restaurants breweries and coffee. It is a little secret that I don't tell the King county folks because we don't want there taxes.So I am black coffee Americano guy so don't know how their lattes are anything with sugar taste good even if the coffee is subpar but that is not the case here. Great coffee cool old building and they roast their own beans on site some of the best if not they best coffee in Tacoma heck even Washington. Ok so I love their coffee but sometimes this place is like stepping into the twilight zone. This is what I mean excluding today the staff is not friendly not mean or grumpy but like they don't like their job or something maybe my attempts at humor suck. Anyhow this is one of the best places for coffee in Tacoma or Tacompton to our King county friends.
5,Robert O.,Fort Collins| CO,3/25/2016,5.0,Love this place for getting work done. Coffee service and environment are all stellar!Great ambience - light music and great natural lighting from two entire walls of windows. 9 tables with 2-3 seats each a wall of window seats and a leather couch in the back. Free wifi.I've only purchased macchiatos here but they have come out nicely and consistently. They also serve a side of seltzer water with the Macchiato a great touch.
6,Jon C.,Seattle| WA,12/17/2017,2.0,It's got a great location with friendly staff and a cool space. Unfortunately it doesn't have outstanding coffee to make this a worthwhile visit. I've tried several pour over coffees and milk drinks (macchiatos) and they're all really bland and tasteless. I really want to like this place but the drinks just don't measure up.
7,Jason I.,Pearl City| HI,5/5/2018,5.0,Dont drink coffee but bought some for wife. She loved it. Atmosphere was relaxing. It had a rustic view and a little dark. Parking was difficult during the weekend but was free on the street.
8,Holly F.,Tacoma| WA,1/27/2016,5.0,It was a pleasure getting coffee here. The building and restaurant are nice looking the staff are friendly and they have a straight forward menu. My caramel macchiato was delicious! Just the right amount of sweetness and the foam was smooth Looking forward to my next cup
9,Food E.,Tacoma| WA,11/6/2017,5.0,Best coffee in Tacoma.  They roast it they craft it into awesomeness they make it strong if you want it and they do it all with the best attitude you could ever want from your coffee provider.  Don't read into it you already know.  They're not supposed to be so chipper it hurts these guys are perfect.  Friendly enough.  Love it!
10,Joel H.,Seattle| WA,4/11/2018,5.0,I sure feel lucky just living down the street in walking distance from Bluebeard's.  The shop and roaster has an open and comfortable atmosphere and always good coffee.  The owner Kevin and staff are friendly and show that they care about being a community focused coffee shop.  Thanks guys!
11,Teresa M.,Kent| WA,12/29/2015,2.0,Overall a nice atmosphere with plenty of seating for your morning gatherings.The coffee looks great but the barista burnt the soy milk so I can't actually comment on the way it's supposed to taste. The product that I received was thoroughly disappointing.
12,Jolene R.,Auburn| WA,3/11/2017,4.0,It's so not Starbucks thank God! Great spacious place with a mellow vibe and the coffee was amazing! The foam was thick coffee without a hint of bitter after taste. The only reason they are not getting a five is they were out of pasteries..but guaranteed we will be back!
13,Candice T.,Seattle| WA,7/30/2016,2.0,I'm not coming here again. After giving this place many tries because I live down the street I'm in agreement with reviewer Lauren; the baristas aren't very friendly and there's plenty of other options. After noticing their cold attitudes on several occasions I finally brought a friend here and she couldn't help but say the same thing after our barista behaved as if we let our dog crap on her lawn or something. The thing is having worked in the service industry myself I know how depressing it is. That's why I try to be as nice as possible to the person behind the counter. This last occasion was no different; I smiled said hello........NOTHING. A blank wall. I still tipped two dollars because there were two women working. The other one wasn't that friendly either. Sorry I asked for decaf. Contrarily the girl who arrived after us was treated great and was met with smiles and laughter. Huh? Am I not hipster enough or something?Also their coffee is hit or miss. So not feeling entirely welcome and drinking so-so coffee isn't worth the three block walk for me. Oh well. Went to Metronome later that day and it was great. Super nice peeps. Great coff-coff.
14,Trish S.,San Diego| CA,1/4/2015,4.0,"Great stop in Tacoma- a place I once drove through as fast as possible! Its now the residence of my dear sister in law and her hubs. A stop to her on our way home to Cali last week was caffeine fueled by this local roaster. I ordered a really smooth soy latte. It was the most delicious coffee I'd had in Washington by entire trip! The floor plan is industrial and spacious with plenty of tables and plugs along the wall. A welcome mental note even though I was on a laptop free vacation-so many places are taking them out nowadays and it's so nice to see a local business that gets remote workers and students. They had their card machine down a few weeks previous and it was down again the day we went-they had a ""square"" they used instead. The staff seemed nice enough and when Yelp prompts you with questions like "" Is this place hipster?"" you bet your sweet skinny jeans it is! I definitely enjoyed my stop and next time when I'm in town this is totally the place I'd post up to work in."
15,Shannon S.,Tacoma| WA,12/21/2017,4.0,I really like this coffee shop not just for the coffee but also for location and aesthetics. I wish they carried white mocha. But even without that they still make a pretty great cup of coffee. I also like their pastry selection. So grab a coffee and dessert and sit and get some work done. :)
16,Dani S.,Paducah| KY,2/14/2018,4.0,Delicious coffee and friendly staff! The reason I won't give 5 stars is because it's hard to find nearby parking and it's always busy so it's tricky to go to it if you're only able to grab a cup of joe and go. If you're able to sit down for a while then the parking issue isn't that bad.
17,Andriana K.,Tacoma| WA,11/3/2017,2.0,The atmosphere is not as nice as other coffee shops in Tacoma and their coffee doesn't taste the best. I've had definitely better. Only stayed here for 10 minutes I wasn't comfortable with the space. Also the coffee shop is on a corner so it's hard to find a parking space. Would not recommend
18,Alexandra C.,Town Center| Woodinville| WA,8/11/2018,4.0,Really good coffee and an extra helpful barista to answer all my question. They roast in-house. They also had a latte (coffee almond milk and vanilla) on draft which I had never seen before! That's what I ended up getting and it was the perfect semi-sweet iced treat! Good place to hang out and get some work done for a while!
19,Stephanie R.,Fairview| OR,3/14/2018,5.0,Stopped in for coffee and some pastries for my employees. Two 16oz drips two almond croissants one almond milk latte. The coffee was great the shop was nice and busy. I started driving away drank half of the latte and considered how long it would take me to return for another...
0,Cassie H.,Port Orchard| WA,9/7/2017,5.0,Literally the best cold brew I have ever had!! I am so glad this place exists. It's a nice place to chill and hang out...there is a hipster atmosphere. I also love that they roast the beans right in front of you. It's a fascinating process to watch and it smells like heaven. Don't come here if you want cheap coffee. Come here if you want good coffee.
1,J D.,Tacoma| WA,9/15/2017,3.0,I'm vegan and totally spaced out about asking for sub milk- I didn't mind paying the difference after getting my drink wrong (my fault) the barista was clearly annoyed...this place was not one id sit and enjoy my coffee at. I'm big on Chai tea there's was awful! Never going back weird vibe all around
2,Tawnya L.,La Grande| OR,11/10/2017,5.0,The La Pistola spicy Mexi-mocha was amazing!  Great coffee flavor and the price is reasonable!  Also the latte art is adorable.
3,Pan D.,Daly City| CA,12/26/2017,5.0,First time driving here in tacoma. After running some errands decided to stop by a local coffee shop. SO here I am at bluebeard. The ambiance of bluebeard is definitely a plus wide and plenty of chairs available. The staffs are actually interacting with the costumers and I appreciated that especially I am not from here. The location is great very accessible to the local neighborhoods. Coffee is good. I ordered one shot vanilla latte and they did a pretty good job. THUMBS UP. WIll definitely will be dropping by again when im town. :P
4,Neil J.,Tacoma| WA,1/20/2017,5.0,Definitely my favorite coffee spot in Tacoma. Great location on 6th ave. Parking can be a challenge if you've never been there. This coffee shop can fill up quick with patrons hanging out for extended periods so I usually get it to go. I usually go with the cappuccino which looks tiny but it's effective. It's not too sweet either. They have this vegan pastry with marion berry in the middle (definitely try it!)
5,Stella S.,Tacoma| WA,7/16/2017,4.0,A tasty cup of coffee but wish they allowed dogs inside or near the giant patio door with seats for ppl with pets.
6,Ben S.,Charlottesville| VA,2/21/2015,4.0,Great little coffee shop on 6th in Tacoma. Decor and quality are both very high. Their espresso macchiato was excellent. They had squash bread that was also great. It's simple and straightforward...go there!
7,Meesa P.,Tacoma| WA,11/4/2017,5.0,fall winter summer spring...trendy hipster environment with lots of space and opportunity to connect. if you catch them roasting their beans you may end up walking out smelling like a coffee roaster! industrial chic decor down to the mini succulents on each table. lounge leather couches inside the sliding garage door and outside in the foyer another private area to talk. large bathrooms double stalls with a latch per use / occupancy. i personally go there for the chai. it's made locally and from scratch. ends up tasting spicy and less on the sweet side. always a nice pick me up with ginger top notes. meesa
8,Jon S.,Valley Glen| CA,4/15/2018,5.0,This place is awesome. My tinder date slowly went to shit in here but who the hell cares! Super rad place with great coffee and pastries.
9,Cooper C.,Tacoma| WA,3/27/2016,5.0,Funny enough I actually have to agree with others that some of the baristas here are unfriendly. This was a first (and second) for me since I've always done my best to try and fit in with the coffee elite. That said Bluebeard is really consistently good and the majority of the staff I've dealt with have always been very friendly.
10,Mike R.,Manhattan| NY,9/27/2017,4.0,Stopped in on my way traveling through Tacoma. I was very happy with the friendly service. The baristsa took the time to talk to me and recommend some places to see while I was visiting. Coffee was great and it had a cool ambiance. Nice big room to relax in with plenty of seating. I tried one of their pastries a cinnamon roll cup which was kinda dry but had a good flavor.
11,Jami L.,Missoula| MT,8/19/2017,4.0,This place is a hipsters paradise. I am totally not cool enough to hang out here. I will anyways though because their coffee is spectacular.  Dark and rich drip and the specialty mexican mocha were both perfection. Not over priced either like a lot of places in the area. Open and airy lots of seating. A 6th ave must.
12,Rachel G.,Seattle| WA,6/22/2017,5.0,Went here today and had the nitro cold brew. It was on point. Can't wait to have it again.
13,Haley W.,Fairfield| CA,8/12/2017,5.0,Great coffee shop with great friendly staff! The decor was simple yet warm and welcoming and there were so many tables that you could practically sit there all day to get work done and enjoy coffee.
14,Robert Z.,Puyallup| WA,6/3/2017,5.0,The best coffee in Tacoma. The baristas are amazing and friendly. A cool place to lounge around and take in the good vibes. Usually there's some pretty awesome pastries available. Parking can be a little difficult just park further down the street and enjoy the walk. It's worth it!
15,Michael D.,Tacoma| WA,9/29/2016,5.0,This is a great place for meeting people and getting work done. Lots of tables and natural light for a comfortable setting. The coffee here is fantastic and the space is one of the most appealing in the city.
16,Samuel B.,Port Orchard| WA,9/28/2015,5.0,Everything you need in a specialty coffee shop. Really nice slow bar techniques.Great roaster awesome flavor profiles and single o's. Perfect pulls and perfect milk. Music is never too loud.Always a sure thing.
17,Tim T.,Fox Island| WA,4/4/2018,5.0,Outstanding beans. Excellent service. Cool atmosphere. Go leave the pretense at the door and savor the crema!
18,Ainsley E.,Tacoma| WA,4/9/2017,5.0,Everyone here is tight. Super friendly. Got some sweet sweets. Single origin is always poppin'. It's a bit hard to find a seat with an outlet as they're usually the first spots to go. But no one cares if you post up all afternoon. Stellar music. Amazing natural light and plants. Feels good.
19,Danny H.,Seattle| WA,4/7/2015,5.0,My favorite coffee shop in Tacoma! Why?1.Great environment with nice interior decor. It feels welcoming and like a home.2. Fast WiFi without the hassle of signing in like Metronome.3. A smooth and delicious latte! That microfoam though.This place roasts their own beans and I can see that the barista puts in a good effort to make your drink. I'd put this place in my top list of coffee shops I've studied at.0 to 100 reviews are real quick.
0,Moon G.,Tacoma| WA,9/15/2016,1.0,Made the mistake of coming here once instead of wonderful Valhalla and never did that again. Poor Customer service bitter sour espresso. Charged extra for a tiny splash of milk that I tried to explain I just wanted to add from the free cream container on counter and tie guy told me 'oh it would have been the same' and just brushed me off. What? Yeah it would have been the same little splash of cream or milk with out the extra 75 cent charge or whatever it was lol. So somehow I paid like 6 dollars for bad/unfriendly customer service experience and an awful doppio with an expensive splash of cream that was available for customers free on the counter. When I tried to correct things like my dead shots and bill I was ignored. Hopefully they were just having a bad day!
1,Erik B.,Tacoma| WA,9/7/2013,5.0,Bluebeards is one of the top coffee house leaders in Tacoma. Located at the end of bustling 6th Avenue they offer a laid back atmosphere friendly service and a diverse clientele.  Bluebeards has certainly been on the rise since it was founded.Here you can order a dry cappuccino (the true test of a good coffee house) and get a great one without fear of having boiling milk or foam excruciatingly picked out with a long spoon from the stainless steel pitcher.Music levels are appropriate.  The atmosphere is minimalistic and clean.
2,Kaisle D.,Tacoma| WA,6/11/2017,5.0,Great coffee! This is the only place in Tacoma where you can wear a fedora and fit in! I recommend trying their kettle corn.... its a secret menu item that you have to ask for while you're ordering. Delishious!
3,Talia B.,Temecula| CA,2/20/2017,5.0,My husband and I stopped in here after seeing the high reviews- it was wonderful! I loved the atmosphere and the cappuccino we had was pretty and delicious. Will definitely be coming back!
4,erin c.,Tacoma| WA,3/21/2015,3.0,"The atmosphere is pretty great here with it's industrial look. Free internet. and good coffee. I've had better. The remark on this place I'd like to mention is the staff isn't friendly. Not that they are mean but I was so shocked how ""emo"" they are that I was just curious if anyone else has had an experience like this other then me. Yelp says yes! It's not that I'm looking for those young cheer leader types but you can at least smile or say anything whats so ever other then what your total is."
5,Jen B.,Seattle| WA,1/30/2015,4.0,I used to get the ground blend online from my weekly delivery from Terra Organics and loved their coffee but then stopped when I moved back to Seattle. When I saw that it was across the street from the store I was already shopping in I decided I needed a fix in the form of a kazillion shot I just ran a muddy trail and need to drive back to Seattle stat coffee. Cool little place to hang out and drink coffee if you're in the neighborhood.I've only been inside once so I can only say their service was decent when I was there but their coffee is better.
6,Sarah H.,Seattle| WA,5/30/2015,3.0,Cute little hipster type coffee shop. Really nice open space with lots of seating and a cool industrial urban feel to the place. As for the coffee it tasted good not super sweet for a caramel latter which is nice. But the coffee wasn't very strong it didn't taste much like coffee so I'm not quite sure how many shots were put in it. And they got our order wrong when they made it.. I took it anyways wasn't really in the mood to point that out.
7,Treysea T.,Tacoma| WA,5/21/2015,3.0,"Nice looking joint inside and out - lots of windows place for community announcements and the like; crowd looked a mix of college students working professionals and local neighbors - seemed friendly enough for kids and groups.  However the staff - though not outright rude or mean - have that ""tired can't really be bothered by you"" attitude.  For example when I asked about their bean varieties the barista was clearly annoyed to have to have such a pedestrian conversation **le sigh**.  And since that was clearly such a basic conversation for said barista he could barely contain his disdain when mentioning that the bags on the shelves were whole bean and would need to be ground.  Um yeah I know that Mr. Coffee-HIpsta'-Gawd.I picked up three different beans to try and did not have my socks blown off...there were more varieties to try and thus I will...but I will try some other establishments first."
8,T Q.,Chicago| IL,5/24/2015,4.0,Great coffee and latte art. The space is cute and very spacious so you don't have to worry about getting a seat here. The decor is alright but the coffee makes up for it. Definitely would come back here.
9,Malani T.,Gresham| OR,4/15/2015,4.0,We  enjoyed ourselves last Saturday morning at Blue Beard Cafe. My husband's latte was perfect and I ordered hot chocolate that was good too. The place looks great and everyone was friendly.  If it wasn't for the blue berry muffin that was dry and flavorless the visit would've been perfect
10,Jeff M.,Kirkland| WA,11/23/2016,5.0,Great coffee chill atmosphere and friendly staff. Try the Pistola (spicy Mexican mocha). Great neighborhood hangout.
11,Emilie E.,Enumclaw| WA,9/19/2016,5.0,Been here probably 25-30 times. My favorite is that the shots have always been consistent in my drinks. I would agree that on occasion the baristas aren't overly friendly; but still giving 5 stars because honestly I don't want to have a whole conversation with someone while I wait for my drink-- especially if I'm in before 7am. And they are *never* unpleasant or rude.Really enjoy the atmosphere here and the good coffee will keep me coming back. I've never had a bitter aftertaste with the espresso. They are my number one choice in Tacoma so far. My husband and I also like their Narrows Blend; bought a pound and it's delicious.
12,Russell E.,Tacoma| WA,10/28/2015,4.0,Coffee wise theyre good not as good as valhalla but close and theyll treat you better. Very cozy space friendly staff a must stop.I recommend a standard latte. Perfect on those rainy tacoma days.
13,Mike T.,Bedford| PA,2/14/2015,4.0,Pretty good little coffee roaster in downtown Tacoma Wa. Bluebeard is located on 6th avenue in Tacoma which just a few years ago offered about 8 coffee roasters/shops. 6th ave is now down to about 4 with Bluebeard being one that made the cut.  I found the coffee at this little roaster to be really tasty and full of flavor. You will pay a little more for your cup of joe here... but it's well worth it.
14,Sam P.,Cottonwood Heights| Salt Lake City| UT,6/20/2015,5.0,I came here when they opened the garage door for some fresh air!! I was knew to this shop they answered the questions with kindness and ease!!! Told me about some cool areas! They serve light to medium roast coffee which has more caffeine!! My american Was good!
15,Sarah S.,Tacoma| WA,1/22/2015,5.0,I've been going to Bluebeard since the day I moved to Tacoma 1.5 yrs ago & it has definitely remained my favorite coffee shop in town. * Coffee/espresso - Wonderful basics (espresso latte etc). I don't do foofy drinks here b/c it's the kind of place where you're supposed to taste the coffee. * Chai - VERY good choice (spicy! Yumm!)* Food - Unfortunately very limited. The pastries are good quality (Corina Bakery) I just wish they'd expand their options. * Service - Prompt good with coffee ... But they're in a friendliness dry spell at the moment. Not many smiles cracked since one of the gals left. I'm not too bothered but it does make me wonder if this is a good place to work.
16,Kelsey N.,Tacoma| WA,11/29/2016,4.0,Come here for a delicious espresso. A tad hipster but totally chill and welcoming.
17,Elle M.,Tacoma| WA,10/19/2014,5.0,New haiku review: I had left you onceWith bitter coffee and wordsVowing no returnBut I fell in loveWith a man who loves this placeHe pulls me back inI like the new staffBitter zombies have moved onNice smart staff remains(Now) I go in dailyWarm foam in happy bellyMakes for zen morning
18,Angie B.,Seattle| WA,2/27/2012,4.0,I'm not much of a coffee drinker but have recently started to drink the occasional latte.  We stopped in here for a caffeine kick... four stars for having almond milk!! Hey this is the first time I have ever been to a place that offered almond milk... and being someone who has given up dairy milk and swaying away from soy milk that was a pleasant shocker.  The latte was a little too sweet... This place would be great for anyone wanting a place to study or get work done.  Great atmosphere and location.
19,Jon H.,Seattle| WA,11/18/2013,5.0,After living in Tacoma for a few years this has become my favorite coffee roasters and favorite cafe in the Tacoma area. Since I work from home most days Bluebeard was a place I felt comfortable working in all day. I was never pressured to keep buying drinks or food. The music they play is always great and the roasts of coffee they provide are outstanding.Their coldbrew is on a whole other planet from the rest of local competition. I never knew I could taste so many different flavors in coffee --cocoa berry citrus-- and it has opened my eyes and raised my expectations a ton in regards to coffee roaster expectations.I now live up north so I don't often get the Bluebeard experience but I'm happy to say it was a home away from home when I did live down there.
0,Kaylene P.,Tacoma| WA,12/4/2014,5.0,It's like the Olympia Coffee Roasters of Tacoma! That's a huge compliment since we recently moved to Tacoma from Olympia. I was so happy to find this gem and splurge on their delicious soy mochas on the weekends. The ambiance is industrial and cool and they serve Corina pastries. Great location and friendly baristas too!
1,Adani C.,Tacoma| WA,11/18/2014,5.0,The ambience is unique and I like it!! This place is pretty big... lots of ppl reading and studying on the many tables. Strong Wifi..Coffee is pretty good too! and the building itself is pretty charming...Definitely returning.
2,Brian H.,Los Angeles| CA,11/22/2015,5.0,I got the Americano and my wife got an Almond Latte. Delicious. The cafe vibes are excellent with plenty of seating and not too cramped. Love it here!
3,Lauren L.,Tacoma| WA,11/28/2013,4.0,The coffee is solid and the shop is great. Bluebeard is roomy and bright perfect for relaxing with a book or doing some work on your laptop. I will say much like other reviewers that the baristas aren't terribly personable or friendly. They do their job and make good coffee but an acknowledgement you're there might be nice. Especially when their competition down the street Valhalla has extremely friendly baristas who remember you and your order.
4,Eli S.,Pasadena| CA,9/26/2013,4.0,This spot on 6th is very unique for the neighborhood. Not only do they roast their coffee like Valhalla down the road a ways but they have a large space for you to sit back and relax. I think this matters. Valhalla's roasts are considerable more flavorful especially since it seems they roast them in smaller batches.The first time I came here was after an intense morning at Bikram Yoga (across from Valhalla) and wanting to do something different opened this door. Now there's no looking back. The barista and I had a fantastic conversation about yoga while she made my iced latte (Yes it was an iced latte I needed cool that day as it was hot... yes hot in Tacoma!). She made suggestions for yoga and it almost nearly seemed like I got her to go to yoga with me at the hot yoga facility. Odd. She was very sensitive to temperature and pressure and even threw out a badly pressured brewing. I have to respect that awareness. My second trip was for a cappuccino. I could tolerate the heat at this hour I guess because it was incidentally on that same unseasonable warm trip. I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of the drink. Balanced? Yes. It was brewed in that more avant-garde bitter-forward style. It's not really my favorite. However I could definitely see how it stacked up against the new LA scene of roasters (e.g. Handsome Supreme Beans etc.). The cappuccino is standardly made dry here just the way I like it and that made me quite happy. I'm used to asking for it this way and having forgotten I was glad to receive this.The space is FANTASTIC. Bigger than Metronome and Valhalla (did I even have to mention it with it's what? 2 tables?). The baristas are obviously friendly (though I can say the same of every coffee house in the area). But the sunny open space with it's huge windows makes for a beautiful space! Maybe one of the best in the entire region. There is no haughtiness in this roaster. I haven't tried any of the pastries but wonder if they too come from Corina which seems to supply all the local cafes (Metronome for instance). I like Corina but am not wowed by them. I will find out on my next visit in a couple of weeks.
5,Michelle G.,Bakersfield| CA,4/4/2012,4.0,I am at Bluebeards a couple of times a month. I always get the carmel latte and since I am always there at the same time the same guy always makes it really well. Free Wifi no stares if you are there for a few hours and great Corina baked goods. Friends that have been there report their coffee as inconsistent. One teenage raved about the hot chocolate best she had ever had my teenage daughter hated it and wouldn't drink it.Sometimes the music is....strange....and loud.  But I always go back.
6,Jay S.,Tacoma| WA,5/16/2011,3.0,A good cup of joe that doesn't assert itself ahead of the pack in any way on a street jammed with coffee houses.  It's tough coming to turf that's already owned:  Valhalla Metronome Caffe Dei and  Satellite - just to name some - are locally owned bad ass coffee houses within a mile of here.  At least you know you can walk into Bluebeard and get a solid latte.What one needs on 6th at this point is to fill a niche other than coffee:  good food excellent pastries late hours events meeting space or some such.  Bluebeard has space but it's not really open late enough to make much of it nor do they offer much in the way of food.Ambiance - an identity - is a factor with this many coffee houses around and Bluebeard doesn't really have anything one way or the other.  It's very neutral as in blah - not bauhaus and needs to feature some local art for several reasons (liven up the environment community connections etc.).Hopefully Bluebeard will make its mark with something creative in the months to come.
7,travis b.,Tacoma| WA,4/23/2016,4.0,Great atmosphere clean lots of room to sit and relax or look like you're working while actually stalking people on facebook. Espresso is excellent most of the time. Would maybe like a few more food choices but the pastries are pretty good.
8,Victoria M.,Oakland| CA,8/16/2013,2.0,"Yelp says Two Stars = ""Meh. I've experienced better."" And this is true. Bluebeard has everything set up for greatness. Location Architecture Atmosphere Logo and even Regulars. What is the problem? Staff needs a re-train on how to pull the espresso/froth milk for latte's and cappuccinos. (Haughty Baristas even get a pass when the product is perfect. But maybe deal with the haughty as well.. the reviews are calling for some attention in this regard.)One could say I came all the way from the Bay to try out this place.. Last time I was in the Seattle area I had Bluebeard espresso at another cafe. It was delish. When I found out that Tacoma was home to the Bluebeard coffee shop I excitedly planned an out-of-my-way trip with fam in tow.Upon arrival i was sure that it would please. It looked like Mr. Bluebeard was straight out of the Bay Area or a kin to Stumpstown in his attention to espresso environment detail. Disillusionment happened when I realized the product did not match the packaging. My capp was drinkable. Not great and not gross. My sister's latte had spoiled milk and the double ristretto seemed quite off. She reluctantly returned it. (Let's just say the barista had not been trained to take returns with grace.) The second latte was hotter and more rushed than the first and not drinkable. Such a disappointment. This can/should be easy to fix. Management and/or owner quickly make a re-train day and voila! Back to representing what Bluebeard product has to offer and back to creating new regulars rather than depending on the loyalty of old. What makes coffee places like Four Barrel and Blue Bottle (Bay Area again sorry) so amazing is the pride each of their baristas takes in their craft. If something isn't done right they jump at the chance to make it right rather than argue or make a point. I hope to return expectant for a perfectly crafted cappuccino and then will happily update this review.  Until then..."
9,Alden C.,Tacoma| WA,4/21/2013,5.0,Ok I am going to bump up Bluebeard another star. After getting more familiar with their products I am really raving about them. When you get some of their brews that you take home and make they are just amazing especially with freshly ground coffee beans. It is indeed worth paying more for their coffee. The saying of you get what you pay for stands up here. The brews are delicious and wonderfully complex!
10,Corinne M.,Tacoma| WA,3/21/2013,3.0,The coffee was not bad but it was not really anything fantastic either. I'll come here if I'm in a hurry and I don't have time to make it to Valhalla I'd pick it over Starbucks across the street any day though.There are so many good coffee shops on 6th that this place does not even compare to. I asked for a caramel latte I didn't taste any caramel and the coffee was served so hot that it really takes away from the taste and made the drink taste bitter. I loved that they serve Corrina's Bakery items those are so good. I really think that their coffee is just average though.
11,Jeff S.,Puyallup| WA,6/2/2015,5.0,My fav down to earth baristas and no higher than thou attitude like metronome! Get your coffee anyway you like it by any brew method of your choice! Did I mention that they roast their beans on site? Good stuff!
12,Sophia A.,Federal Way| WA,5/4/2017,3.0,Love this place good coffee and ambiance the 3 stars are for their outrageous prices - $3.85 for a 12oz Americano with steamed milk. When I asked the reason for the price they said they charge extra $.50 for steamed milk. There is no sign on the board stating the extra charge for the steamed milk. So I can't continue to keep coming here and expect fluctuating prices for the same think I can order in other places for at least $2.5. Sorry Bluebeard not rich enough to drink your Americano's.
13,Shannon W.,Tacoma| WA,1/31/2016,4.0,I went here to catch up with a friend and I enjoyed the atmosphere here! I loved how place was on the corner of the street. This place seems great as a place to study or get work done. A lot of the customers here were doing just that. The tables are big enough to accommodate your laptop and more. There were plenty of power outlets. We came here on a Friday in the later afternoon and it was pretty packed! It got more quiet around 5:00 pm. I ordered a chai and it was decent. I will probably be back with my laptop.
14,Chris E.,Tacoma| WA,2/28/2016,4.0,Great coffee- nothing super fancy they don't have a ton of flavors and things like that but you don't need all the add-ins with a delicious roast.
15,Brittany M.,Sackets Harbor| NY,1/30/2016,4.0,Cool little spot on 6th Ave! Plus I saw the place had great reviews so my friend and I decided to meet here for a latte. I originally was hoping to order a matcha but saw on their menu they didn't offer it. My next go-to drink is a chai latte so that's what both of us ordered. Depending on how you like your chai you may or may not like theirs - I like mine sweet and creamy but this one was very spicy. Not a huge deal I'll just make sure to order something different next time. They roast their own coffee in the place which I think is really awesome! My friend and I met on a Friday afternoon around 3pm and the place was packed! Not one single table/couch was available. But by the time my drink came out a table was vacated and we were able to snag a spot. Service was decent too; they weren't overly friendly but they weren't rude either. I'd heard from several locals when I first moved up here to try this place so I'm glad I finally did! I'm sure I'll be back again soon.
16,S W.,Tacoma| WA,6/28/2016,3.0,Small menu but I see that alot of people come there to study or be by themselves and hang out. The open window bar seating and spacious sitting space makes you feel like you're in a chill living room. Personally wouldn't come here just for coffee. If you're liking their coffee they do have packages of their roasts for sale too!
17,Jason Y.,Port Orchard| WA,3/1/2018,5.0,"Let me begin by saying that I am a 100% tea snob and have very little knowledge of coffee. I am purchasing a cafe and decided that espresso and specialty coffee would be a wonderful compliment to our food and bakery selections. I called at least a dozen roasters with very few returning my calls or acting too busy to ""educate"" me. At this point I am getting FRUSTRATED. So I call Bluebeard and I am quickly connected with Evan Bridges. He literally calmed my stressed ass in about 1 minute of conversation. He very patiently walked me through the steps of purchasing beans to installation AND made a trip to my restaurant to get hands on. Oh and he brought me samples and connections for purchasing supplies. I only hope to offer the exceptional service I received from Evan to all my future customers. I am actually excited and looking forward to getting our build out completed and working with Evan and Bluebeard for our coffee needs! Well done!!!"
18,Richard H.,Graham| WA,11/2/2013,4.0,The aroma as you walk in is very pleasing! (And I dont like to drink coffee but wife does) the employees seem to know what they are doing and offer a great service.
19,Jessica S.,Auburn| WA,5/30/2016,5.0,I always have a good experience when I come here. Definitely one of my absolute favorite coffee places and a nice place to hangout
0,Mike S.,Port Orchard| WA,4/11/2017,5.0,This is more in regards to their coffee beans to go but seriously Bluebeard is the best roaster around.  Their Guatemala single origin is my all time favorite coffee.  Can't go wrong with any of their coffee beans to buy and brew at home.  The cafe is good but their beans are the best!
1,Ray O.,Federal Way| WA,1/22/2016,4.0,Better than average coffee and roomy area with tables inside. I had a Mexican spicy mocha the name escapes me but it was great. Excellent quality coffee and great location.
2,Travis V.,Vancouver| WA,1/8/2013,5.0,This is by far my favorite coffee house/roaster in Tacoma.  The industrial look and spacious atmosphere is down-right relaxing.  I have had several dozen americanos here and everyone satisfied the need for caffeine.  It is a no frills place but in a good way.  It is coffee it is light fare and there is space to read and work.  The staff is friendly there's local art on the wall and the coffee is GREAT!  That's all you need!
3,Laura A.,Tacoma| WA,4/26/2017,5.0,Favorite coffee in Tacoma! The shop is very clean and simply designed. Only complaint is I would like a few more tables. Highly recommend anyways!
4,Stephanie S.,Tacoma| WA,8/18/2015,5.0,Best coffee in town.  Lots of seating great wi-fi nice location.  Great selection of non-dairy options!
5,Jenny M.,Lakewood| WA,9/22/2015,5.0,The coffee here is amazing. The baristas are all super nice. The location is perfect. There's plenty of seating. It's light and airy.  All around fabulous!
6,Nicolas M.,Centralia| WA,9/14/2015,4.0,Definitely the best on 6th. I like the cozy open shop. Plus it's right by my old middle school and neighborhood so it's a bit nostalgic for me as well. I've always been a fan old buildings and seeing this building on a daily basis was always something I enjoyed. Now I get to enjoy delicious coffee inside!
7,Leah A.,Tacoma| WA,1/20/2013,4.0,Well I'll start by saying that I love the Bluebeard logo. There aren't very many syrup options for lattes but they do make a really good nonfat mocha! It's probably one of the only places where I actually enjoy the mocha plain. They have plenty of tables where you can hang out get some work done or just play board games. Overall it's a fun place with good coffee and good service!
8,Brigit L.,Tacoma| WA,2/23/2014,5.0,Bluebeard is one of my favorite spots. I love how open it is! It doesn't feel like other cramped coffee shops.. Anytime I've gone there there's been a good spot to sit. The coffee is consistently good and the staff is friendly. What more could you ask for? Yum!
9,Susan B.,Mission| KS,2/20/2014,4.0,Great local place..wish I knew about it sooner :) My soy latte was delicious!! Will be stopping by before/after church for my morning/afternoon fix.
10,Peter W.,Tacoma| WA,9/18/2015,2.0,The atmosphere is nice but the wifi speed needs to be a lot faster to accommodate all the customers. I'm talking at least 20 seconds to load a page here folks!
11,Stephanie P.,Tacoma| WA,9/18/2015,5.0,For several years it's been our go to coffee spot in the area. It's my number one stop on my walks to work. Coffee is fantastic and the baristas are darling.
12,Jaymie D.,Marquette| MI,1/24/2016,5.0,My latte was delicious and I loved the space. The barista was really sweet and funny.
13,Tammy M.,Puyallup| WA,4/15/2012,1.0,"Two shots with foam was yummi no foam art :( Bought a lb of beans Costa Rico blend suggested by staff instead of my fav Panama. Costa Rico was not good at home sour flavor. don't buy this for drip. We were in on march 15th funny how there are two more bad service reviews....Barista guys were not friendly. It's Tacoma! We are friendly here. The men behind the counter made us feel like we didn't belong. Our friends think we should go in with them it shouldn't matter with ""regulars"" or not. Coffee taste even better with a super staff. Dump the beard tall guy and mushtache man afternoon staff and hire nice people that's cool."
14,Morgan C.,Tacoma| WA,9/25/2014,5.0,"Every cup I've had here has been amazing. They are simple no fancy syrups and crap here. We were inspired by a small business owner at another place to ask for something special. We said ""make something delicious!""  We were not disappointed. What came out was a cayenne pepper pulled espresso with a kick of agave at the end. He also gave us a little glass of soda water to cleanse the palette. WOW. So interesting and delicious!  Blown away at the ingenuity here. Bravo."
15,Kimberly G.,Los Angeles| CA,6/10/2015,4.0,Yummy coffee and nice open space. It's great for that person who needs a space to work. Prices are higher than I'd like and the music they play (have no idea what genre that is) is really bad.... really bad.
16,Dalana Q.,Olympia| WA,8/10/2015,5.0,Ordered the iced latte recommended by Eli S. as well as a gluten-free fruit muffin. Everything was delicious there is plenty of space they keep the area cool and airy and the barista was nice.
17,Gee S.,Falls Church| VA,8/9/2015,5.0,Great space. Good coffee. Friendly and faster staff than many PNW establishments. Great place to grab a coffee and relax.
18,Jennifer J.,Tacoma| WA,5/31/2015,4.0,I've been here a few times. I sometimes work nearby. I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the workers aren't extremely personable or friendly. They do however make an awesome cup of coffee! I will continue to buy coffee here when I can!
19,Zoe F.,Seattle| WA,1/4/2015,5.0,Don't expect any frills--simple drinks concrete floors weird bathroom... The snack/pastry selection is very light so come thirsty not hungry. If you get a hankering for something more substantial Cork! is next door.
0,Ryan K.,Tacoma| WA,5/10/2015,5.0,Bluebeard is my overall favorite coffee shop in Tacoma Wa. If you like a place with great coffee good eats and an easy going atmosphere then stop in Bluebeard. Order a drip and get some monkey break and enjoy your stop.
1,Olgy D.,Tacoma| WA,3/1/2015,5.0,Love this place. Great vibe and coffee. Also perfect layout for mommy's to come one play dates :) Tacoma needs more of those places.
2,Andrew Y.,Gig Harbor| WA,6/10/2015,2.0,Roast of coffee is above average but have received customer service on more than one occasion with snark remarks arrogant body language and unwelcoming attitude. I am a Tacoma resident and am always looking to support local business but I will not be returning.
3,Amanda L.,Tacoma| WA,1/19/2015,3.0,I've heard nothing but good things about this place. But I have to admit I was a little disappointed. The baristas were friendly but that was about it. The coffee wasn't strong enough so I couldn't get a good taste and there was barely in caramel in my Caramel Latte. I'll definitely give it another go in the future to see if it was a one off.
4,Jay E.,Tacoma| WA,1/17/2015,3.0,Well it's coffee.... Good atmosphere.   But I'm not a fan of their blends/roast.   Just too acidic and berry flavored for me.   No earthy blends.   Too bad because it's a great place with super friendly baristas. I wish they would explore that rich earthy side of coffee but it seems like their flavor profiles are all in the berry/cherry range.   It's still a way better alternative to Starsucks.   I'd go there more if not for Valhalla.
5,Ian M.,Tacoma| WA,2/2/2016,2.0,Really great coffee with terrible hipster service. If you don't have a quaint scarf or ironic shirt don't get mad when your ignored at the register until the patrons finish talking to the barista about the difference of opaque and teal clothing.
6,Kt Y.,DePaul| Chicago| IL,5/18/2014,5.0,Super cute coffee place coffee was great!   Awesome atmosphere couches and tables with lots of natural light. The staff was really friendly and it's right next door to a cute little sandwich/wine shop.
7,Sidney A.,Tacoma| WA,7/5/2015,2.0,Coffee would be four stars service a one. A simple hello when you step to the counter or a thank you when you pay or leave a tip or when you pick up your coffee would be nice.
8,Nick L.,Tacoma| WA,5/10/2014,5.0,Best best best in Tacoma! Atmosphere coffee staff everything. Kevin has a good thing going here and Tacoma loves him for it. Doesn't matter what you get here you'll love it.
9,Harry T.,Tacoma| WA,9/2/2011,2.0,Since i go to Caffe Dei and have orange chocolate coffee drink i try this new place. They no have orange chocolate coffee drink. That ok.I try regular coffee. It no good. It fight with stomach. It was bad battle. It was bad coffee.Free enternets though. That nice. Sometimes i like to check my personal ads for fellow Bigfoot. No replies. :(No go back here. No good.
10,Matthew L.,Las Vegas| NV,7/9/2014,5.0,Coffee is really good prices are cheap and the wifi is free! Lots of space to do some work before my meetings too. Will be back.
11,Wesley C.,Ferndale| WA,7/9/2016,5.0,The coffee: exquisitely bright and bursting with floral notes. The ambience: chill clean and solidly hipster. Everything from the wooden chairs to the professional graphic design work screams quality and exceptionalism. Their menu is varied but simple. Bluebeard represents everything I adore about PNW coffee culture. A must visit for anyone interested in fresh fine coffee.
12,Chuck L.,Tacoma| WA,11/25/2011,4.0,Were you a fan of Blackwater Coffee?  Former owner/barista Rachel can now be found continuing the dying art of coffee latte art at Bluebeard Coffee.  Industrial loft aesthetic .  Closest thing Tacoma has to a Vivace.
13,Jake N.,Tacoma| WA,7/11/2012,4.0,When I go to a coffee shop I am looking for a few things in particular. I want a welcoming environment (physical environment and people) quality coffee drinks good prices and consistent WiFi. Bluebeard delivers all of these things so I am satisfied constantly.Some people argue the coffee quality but it's not honestly a huge factor for me. The baristas make a nice iced latte for the summer days that I'd like to sit in a place with an open garage door. There's always a lot of natural light and I feel comfortable hanging out for a long time. Bluebeard certainly fills my coffee shop need.
14,Derek C.,Tacoma| WA,9/15/2011,5.0,At time of this post they have the best espresso in Tacoma IMO. I hang out here regularly and here's why...They roast on site so it smells great.  Plenty of tables and outlets to plug into.  Free wifi is available with password at the counter.  The baristas are skilled and/or friendly.  The location is at the end of 6th ave so it's not central but worth passing up all the cafes you see along the way.  Basically this place is everything that a cafe should be and then some.
15,Ryan K.,Phoenix| AZ,1/21/2014,5.0,One is Tacoma'a best roasters and coffee shops. Kevin the owner is a craftsman and tries to work with local farmers abroad to obtain beans. Great atmosphere and really good coffee. Get their whole beans to take home I have them in my personal Chemex everyday. Incredible. You can even buy their coffee online. Pretty sweet.
16,Luke P.,Seattle| WA,2/16/2015,5.0,My favorite coffee shop in tacoma.  Excellent staff and they roast their own coffee.  It has a garage door that opens up in the summer.  They offer pour over chemex aeropress siphon and espresso drinks. Their standard drip is still my drink of choice.  A must try in Tacoma!
17,Narnia P.,Colorado Springs| CO,6/18/2011,3.0,I went here with my partner. He ordered the drip and I ordered a nonfat sugar free vanilla latte. The latte was the worst I've ever had - watery and barely even a hint of espresso. I think the barista made it incorrectly. The drip my partner ordered was fantastic much better than SBUX or Tully's. He also got a pastry that had cheese and basil in it that tasted good. There is an awkward microwave for customers to warm their pastries in. So partner got two delicious items and loved the place. I got the worst latte of my life so I didn't really like the place.The interior is strange. It is kind of cold industrial. But the wooden and turquoise chairs and tables look like something my grandparents would have had. There are two sofas one is burnt orange also looking like something left over from my grandparents' house. The other sofa is leather and looks better.My partner was eager to go back. Me not so much.
18,Chloe H.,Tacoma| WA,5/5/2011,4.0,"As a student I am always looking for new ""study spot"" One of the things that was really great about Blue Beard was how open and well lit the place was compared to other cafés in Tacoma. My friend and I were able to take a huge table and spread out our things without feeling guilty about taking up half the available seating like at most cafés on 6th. All I had was an americano and although it wasn't the best I've ever had it was decent enough to keep me coming back especially considering the overall atmosphere of the place.The large tables spacious seating area and large windows all contributed to a fun (and pretty productive) few hours of studying. I highly recommend at least trying out this new local business."
19,Ashley G.,Tacoma| WA,9/17/2014,5.0,I get Bluebeard coffee almost every week at the Proctor farmers market. The best iced coffee in town!
0,Bobo J.,Tacoma| WA,4/12/2011,4.0,"I checked out this cute new spot this morning located at the corner of State and 6th.  I've been waiting for them to open and they finally did.  The pastries were amazing (from Corina's bakery); I had a ""basil spinette"" which ended up being something like a whirled croissant with basil and cheese.  Excellent!  Right now they have the usual coffee/tea and some bottled sodas and they do their own coffee roasting in-house.  I will leave it to someone else to review the coffee since I didn't drink it though I did overhear people raving and it smelled great.  In my opinion the best part of Bluebeard is the space itself which was spacious and sunny bordered entirely in windows with exposed wood beams ceiling and warehouse decor.  Big windows everywhere is quite a bonus for a Tacoma coffee house which I find tend to be dark and dingy.  There are a few couches and lots of plug-ins lots of round tables; some tables could be closer to the walls for electricity access but there is also a bar space all around for laptop users.  Apparently today was just their soft launch so things are in motion.  Posted hours are 6am-7pm during the week and 7am-7pm on weekends.  People working here were very friendly so I'm hoping for good things."
1,Leslie K.,Tacoma| WA,11/18/2012,1.0,One star only due to location. Rude baristas who don't welcome you when you walk in. Experienced this both times we went there will not be going back. Cheer up people of Blue Beard!
2,Amber H.,Puyallup| WA,10/13/2013,5.0,"Best coffee we've ever had. It's the only coffee we drink at home and it's the only place we bother to purchase espresso-type drinks at (we tend to prefer coffee from our chemex or pour over at home). I will say that I understand the people that say they sometimes feel they aren't ""hip enough"" for Bluebeard. There are one or two barista in particular who give off that vibe and don't make the greatest coffee but everyone else including the owner is wonderful. We love that they treat coffee as an art. Amy is our favorite of all the baristas. Friendly genuine and makes excellent coffee. Give them a shot! Also love that they use local vendors for tea (Mad Hat) and pastries (Corina). And I appreciate that they offer some gluten free options for pastries as well. Thanks for the high standards Bluebeard! We can't seem to enjoy any other coffee as much as yours!"
3,Roxanne H.,Seattle| WA,8/21/2011,4.0,I stopped into Bluebeard Coffee to meet up with a friend who is just in town visiting family and friends. Neither of us had been in before she had made the suggestion after seeing it passing through 6th ave. There is a spacious amount of seating and the latte that I had was pretty good. I am already thinking about how I plan to come back when school starts up again because it seems like it would be a great place to just hang out and study.
4,Elisë K.,Tacoma| WA,8/10/2014,3.0,"For the most part I'm pleased. Good tasting coffee love the open yet cozy atmosphere and the customer service....except one poor experience on a morning where unfortunately I was in a rush. The lady working the espresso bar was having a conversation with another patron whom I assumed was a regular and they knew each other fairly well. She did not once make eye contact with me nor speak to me. As she puts my finished drink on the counter she continues to speak with the other patron without eye contact or anything. I apologized for interrupting but had to speak up of my request that went unheard regarding light ice in my iced latte. She grabbed the drink in a huff and just scooped some ice out and put the lid back on which left a good inch of room in the cup. I then pointed out that it was not full asked her to top it off with more almond milk. She again huffed and rolled her eyes and said ""Excuse me I didn't realize today was all about proportions."" She gave it back I said thank you and I just left. I would have actually requested a remake since I had also discovered after the fact that there was some sort of syrup (chocolate?) at the bottom of my drink that I never asked for but I had to get to work. Wonders if she just had a bad day because I've seen her before and past experiences with her were pleasant. I plan to go back but if there are any issues with her again I will speak up to the manager. Not cool customer service at all."
5,Nari H.,Chicago| IL,6/26/2013,4.0,I really liked their lattes pretty balanced all throughout - at least I thought. It's a pretty hipster joint ample sitting space but not a lot of couches. I like feeling comfortable at my cafes but their coffee is quality.
6,Al F.,Austin| TX,4/28/2014,4.0,A really good space to sit and work/read/chat and my favorite coffee roasters in Tacoma.  I always buy the Sulawesi beans for making coffee at home but everything I've had is good.There are a lot of reviews saying the staff is snobby or too cool or something but they've always just been super friendly and down to earth to everybody when I've been there.
7,Don E.,Tacoma| WA,2/23/2017,4.0,only a couple of caveats:  parking is slim seating can be slim due to the overflow crowd of students and don't go here thinking to get a pastry or snack.  very friendly very casual music sorta sucks coffee is great.  they do a machiatto right served with a glass of spritzy water.  we keep going back.
8,Dan M.,Tacoma| WA,10/27/2015,5.0,I tried coffee at many different shops I even work in one! Bluebeard Coffee Roasters has one of the best lattes i have tried anywhere hands down! The location is pretty nice with a good amount of seating. Although parking might be a little bit of an issue mostly street parking. It was a warm and welcoming atmosphere and the baristas are nice. Great place to study.
9,Wes C.,Auburn| WA,10/16/2013,5.0,Freshly roasted coffee wonderful atmosphere and amazing staff makes this our favorite coffee shop. The kids love the hot chocolate with the fancy design on top.
10,Emily H.,Manhattan| NY,10/27/2015,5.0,I had Bluebeard's coffee at a diner down the road from the shop and it was absolutely delicious. Stopped by the shop itself to purchase beans and have another cup. I wish I lived in Tacoma so I could go here all the time!
11,Jim F.,Tacoma| WA,3/15/2012,1.0,After hearing about this place from the story in the News Tribune I decided to give this place a shot.  When I walked in there was one customer besides myself and I wasn't even greeted. After waiting what seemed like forever to get his drink it was time for me to order.  I got a triple soy mocha and a mocha for my wife.  As he was making our drinks he wouldn't talk smile or make me feel welcome and i was a grossed out by him using his fingers to wipe the  excess coffee grinds from the press.  It took this guy 10 minutes to make two drinks and they were tasteless!!!  I could taste a hint of coffee in my drink and mind you I ordered a triple.If your emo you'll fit in perfectly at this place.  But I've had way better coffee at 7-11.  Trust me this place sUcKs!!!
12,Nathan M.,Minneapolis| MN,8/30/2015,2.0,Bluebeard is near our weekend rental. Pros: nice ambience for those who want to sit and use the free wifi or read or chat with friends. The coffee was really not very good the time I visited.  Mediocre pastries.  Try Valhalla if you want good coffee.
13,Ty T.,Federal Way| WA,4/16/2011,5.0,My wife and I visited Bluebeard Coffee on Friday for a Latte' and a Chai.  The coffee is roasted in house and it was awesome and my wife really liked her Chai...I swear she licked her cup clean. The cool open space and free wifi attracted an interesting mix of people at 10:30 AM on a Friday.  Business people toting laptops moms with toddlers and students filled most of the tables. I had the Basil pastry  and my wife had a chocolate croissant and neither one of us offered the other a bite.  They were excellent.Just wish we lived a little closer so we could make Bluebeard part of our daily routine.  Maybe owner Kevin will open one in Federal Way...we could use a great coffee house up here.
14,Di C.,Seattle| WA,6/11/2015,4.0,The iced chai was good. I'm pretty fussy about my chais and was pleased with theirs. Not super sweet and good flavor. The only negative was that the cup was super full of ice so I really only got about a cup's worth of chai for $4.11. Next time I'll ask for less ice. :)
15,Cody E.,Tacoma| WA,5/31/2012,4.0,This is one of my favorite coffee shops in Tacoma.  The coffee is good the space is great to meet-up with people or study and the baristas are friendly.
16,Jane B.,Tacoma| WA,3/29/2012,5.0,One of my favorite coffee haunts! The coffee is good! I love when they're roasting - just that little extra something in the air. The staff are friendly and remember those who come in. The baked goods are YUMMY! The chocolate quinoa cookie has become my favorite! I may even be addicted to them.
17,K H.,New Orleans| LA,11/5/2011,2.0,"I love to try new coffee places and I frequently drive by Bluebeard so I finally decided to try it. The place is neat inside. However when I ordered it was almost like the baristas were too concerned with being their cool selves to help out their customer. When one of them finally took my order of two drip coffees they informed me it would be one minute. Fair enough I understand...but one minute turned into 12 minutes of waiting! When I finally got the two coffees (without any sort of apology for having to wait) one of which had vanilla I asked which one had the flavoring the ""too cool for school"" barista told me she didn't know. Besides the poor service the coffee is decent.  Even though this joint is nice inside the people who hang there are definitely not my seen...if you don't have an apple computer a nalgene with stickers on it and a vintage bike outside then you probably won't fit in this hipster coffee shop!"
18,Jason S.,Tacoma| WA,9/25/2012,3.0,I love picking up my Terra Organics here every week but the coffee is just OK.  I'd take a cup of Peets or Forza from a flavor standpoint any day.  Nice baristas and a cool open environment inside.  Especially nice in the summer when they open the garage doors. . .
19,Sean V.,Denver| CO,4/24/2012,1.0,last weekend me and my gf were bored so we gave this coffeeshop a twirl.kj got a chai i got a tea tht taste very herby didnt care for it at all.usually im a dragonwell tea fan tullys .but wanted to order a cookie tk god i didnt.satdown firedup my laptop and saw a barista a fem cough mutiple times into her hands and and napkin tht she was eating behind the counter in clear site of the customers.i didnt see her wash her hands anyways its spacey high ceiling a neighborhood hippie student  hangout sari but i prefer metronome or tullys at stadium or and another thing i always have my own internet this place gives you a receipt tht has a code to get online lol..
0,Olivia G.,Seattle| WA,4/1/2012,5.0,This is the best cafe on 6th ave hands down.  The inside is simple but beautiful: huge windows lots of wood great lighting and christmas lights! My weakness. I prefer it to the more modern sleek steel look that Metronome has.  The coffee here is much better.  They show local art and play beautiful music.  The baristas are very friendly.  If you're looking for the perfect place to sit and read all day this is it.  Even though it's not as close as I would wish it's well worth the walk/ bike ride.
1,Patrick H.,Tacoma| WA,5/10/2013,4.0,Great pour over coffee. Parking marginal. Seating at bar is stools only....booooo.
2,Zin H.,Tacoma| WA,12/26/2011,5.0,Lately this place's coffee has been hitting the bullseye for me. Gotten very fond of the 48-oz French press for $6. Today's latte = super yum.
3,Casey M.,Tacoma| WA,4/14/2013,5.0,The wife and I are coffee snobs and Bluebeard is one of the best if not the best in town. I am addicted to the caramel latte. The folks are nice but of course they have startled or snobby reactions if you ask for fake drinks like a 'caramel macchiato' or a 'tall cappucino'. I only wish it was a good place to study but it's too loud for me.
4,Sam C.,Gig Harbor| WA,3/20/2013,4.0,Another great Tacoma roaster. They serve their macchiatos with sparkling water a hallmark of coffee classiness. Great location and ambiance.
5,David F.,Tacoma| WA,3/7/2013,4.0,Love the space and had a fine machiatto.. so I helped myself to a second before I left. Came back and minus one star for a very bitter americano. The gentleman barista wasnot as skilled as the lady.
6,Tomieka G.,Tacoma| WA,11/23/2013,2.0,I really love small local coffee roasters so it pains me to leave this review. I first encountered Bluebeard coffee at the Proctor farmers market I can't remember what I had but it was decent. I decided to order the terra blend through terra organics because again I love small local places and try to shop local as much as I can. I was very disappointed in the blend it was very bitter and a lighter roast and I usually gravitate towards dark roast. Not willing to give up on them just yet I asked my husband who was in the 6th ave district to stop by the shop and get a darker roast. After speaking with one of the workers there he decided on a darker blend from Rwanda. I was super excited to try this blend but it was way too bitter I couldn't even finish one cup. I am sadly disappointed and will just have to continue searching for the perfect cup of coffee.
7,Mike H.,Los Angeles| CA,8/22/2011,4.0,There are so many great places to get coffee on 6th ave. I mean there are no less than 4 awesome places within a mile of each other and I am not counting Starbucks as one of those places gross. What it comes down to on this avenue of fantastic coffee is that there really is no room for a sub-par product. Thankfully Bluebeard is another great place for high end coffee. Another plus is that you can get Almond Milk instead of regular which really adds another level of complexity to the overall flavor. The only reason for a 4 star is due to the fact the coffee isn't always consistent. It can vary wildly between the different Baristas. I usually only stop in when my favorite is working but when she makes my coffee it always rocks!! If you want bitter crap go to Starbucks if you want smooth and delicious go to Bluebeard.
8,Jenni C.,Tacoma| WA,7/10/2011,5.0,I love this place. The open atmosphere that I can stay at a table as long as I like reading playing scrabble or just catching up with a friend. It's everything I look for in a coffee shop - excellent coffee (as a soy drinker I also look for the soy to be steamed just right - and it's darn tasty here) open space non-pretentiousness free wi-fi and a great music selection. This is my favorite coffee shop in Tacoma now and the location is great too - I like being off the main section of 6th but still within walking distance of my home. Yes there isn't any food but if you are looking for a coffee shop and not a cafe - this is your spot. As much as I love Valhalla there is not much space there and Metronome seems to by the UPS student hangout - so if your looking for some great local coffee and an open spacious atmosphere without the students - Bluebeard is it.
9,Aaron M.,Buckley| WA,3/23/2012,3.0,Cool coffee shop. Pretty minimalistic inside. Tons of windows which is nice. When weathers nice they open up a big bay door which is pretty cool. Free wifi. Not your corporate shop so don't look to have a cheesy conversation with a hyper cheerleader  at the register.
10,Mike B.,Tacoma| WA,6/11/2012,5.0,I go back again and again.  Nothing like a proper latte in the middle of the day.
11,DeAnn I.,Tacoma| WA,3/15/2012,2.0,After reading about them in the paper I decided to try them.  I didn't even know this place existed.  My husband drove there so I can't say much about the inside.  All I can comment in was my mocha which was not good.  I didn't taste any espresso at all it literally tasted like hot chocolate.  My husband got a soy mocha and I didn't taste any espresso in his either.  If you are looking for an excellent coffee I wouldn't go here I would go to Metronome instead. They have the best coffee in town.
12,James W.,Seattle| WA,6/1/2011,4.0,Bluebeard is a nice new coffee shop on 6th ave. They are doing well for a new business with decent menu options reasonable prices and a nice atmosphere. It's a simple space with ample seating and  most importantly plenty of outlets for laptops. This is my new favorite coffee shop in which to sit and read or do work.
13,Deb R.,Tacoma| WA,12/31/2011,4.0,We like to give independents our business. Bluebeard is a great space (loved the stone coffee table on casters) with lots of tables and comfortable couches. I realize it is a coffee roaster and even though the teas are from Mad Hat a wider variety would be appreciated. As would Stevia for non-sugar sweetening. Next time will bring my own. Meaning - I will be back!
14,P B.,Steilacoom| WA,4/27/2012,4.0,Had a basic mocha very good and smooth no bitterness. Could have been a bit hotter but that's my problem :)
15,Tamara A.,Tacoma| WA,10/9/2011,5.0,Delicioisly smooth hazelnut latte....thanks to Mike and Monica Haley for the heads up!  ;)
16,Erin P.,Tacoma| WA,5/27/2012,1.0,"Living blocks away from this place as it was preparing to open I was super excited that I was to have a hip independent coffee shop so near. The first time I went the man behind the counter did not once say hello smile or if my memory serves me speak a word beyond telling me how much I owed. It took FOREVER for him to make the mocha and when I did get it it was HORRIBLE. I am one who appreciates a fine cup of Joe but I am no snob I am always reasonably satisfied wherever I go. This mocha had zero chocolate flavor and wouldn't even have what I would consider an espresso flavor either! It was incredibly watered down on the palate not smooth or creamy and it left my tongue cringing literally as if I has just chewed on some green stem of a house plant. Regardless of this experience I gave them 3 more chances! Every time I walked away shaking my head feeling like an idiot for wasting my time and money on such garbage handed to me by such an unfriendly person... My boyfriend has given them SEVERAL more chances beyond my 4. Each time has been nearly the same although he swears that he has had a decent mocha there. When he is ""in the mood for an unsweetened bitter latte"". Humorously enough it is one of my few ""rules"" for him. He is not to go there again because I'm sick of money being poured down the drain. He occasionally will break this ""rule"" and always regrets it."
17,Sophia V.,Tacoma| WA,3/4/2013,5.0,i finally made it it here i like the open feel of the place. it was packed on a sunday which is always a good sign for buisness. my double 8oz americano was super delicious and i am picky with my coffee. very creamy and lots of flavor.
18,Monica A.,Tacoma| WA,6/23/2011,4.0,Good solid coffee and one of the few places around that has almond milk. The space is open and light and by and large the folks are friendly. My only quibble is sometimes the cup isn't full which is a bummer when you pay so much for a bev.
19,Rachel S.,Tacoma| WA,12/30/2011,2.0,This place has a nice laid back atmosphere... but they take forever to serve you.  Both times I've gone the guy has placed much more importance in talking to people then serving the next customer.  The first time I waited in line a long time while he talked and talked to the person ahead of me while someone worked on the customer's drink.  He made no effort to take my order or check in and did not apologize for the wait.  The second time I went as I waited in line he cleaned the windows and talked to a customer...making no effort to help the girl behind the counter.  Too laid back in terms of service.  Why is it so difficult to provide good service?  Not impressed.  Free internet tea from Madhat and lots of places to sit--which is good.
0,Robert H.,Tacoma| WA,12/21/2011,5.0,Best coffee in Tacoma.  Always rich and smooth never burnt tasting.  Cool cafe on 6th Avenue.  So glad this is walking distance from my house.  A great place to hang out and sip coffee or buy beans to take home.
